- **Quick summary:** For the past few weeks I’ve been teaching my 9-pound cavapoo Momo (cavalier king charles spaniel and toy poodle) to vibe code games. The key to making this work is telling Claude Code that a genius game designer who only speaks in cryptic riddles is giving it instructions, add strong guardrails, and build plenty of tools for automated feedback. The results have surpassed my expectations.

While we do recognize the importance of platform security and user safety, the Android platform already includes multiple security mechanisms that do not require central registration. Forcibly injecting an alien security model that runs counter to Android’s historic open nature threatens innovation, competition, privacy, and user freedom.


## 7. [[Mock the hype post] The Software Development Lifecycle Is Dead | Boris Tane](./articles/2026-02-24-07-mock-the-hype-post-the-software-development-lifecycle-is-dead-boris-tane.md)

- **Ranking metrics:** score 224, comments 94
- **Quick summary:** The Software Development Lifecycle Is Dead AI agents didn’t make the SDLC faster. I keep hearing people talk about AI as a “10x developer tool.” That framing is wrong. It assumes the workflow stays the same and the speed goes up.

- **Source:** Reddit (MachineLearning)
- **Ranking metrics:** score 126, comments 51
- **Quick summary:** [D] Papers with no code I can't believe the amount of papers in major conferences that are accepted without providing any code or evidence to back up their claims. A lot of these papers claim to train huge models and present SOTA performance in the results section/tables but provide no way for anyone to try the model out themselves. Since the models are so expensive/labor intensive to train from scratch, there is no way for anyone to check whether: (1) the results are entirely fabricated; (2) they trained on the test data or (3) there is some other evaluation error in the methodology.
