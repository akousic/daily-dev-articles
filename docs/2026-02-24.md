## 1. [Ladybird adopts Rust, with help from AI](./articles/2026-02-24-01-ladybird-adopts-rust-with-help-from-ai.md)

- **Ranking metrics:** HN score 1239
- **Quick summary:** We’ve been searching for a memory-safe programming language to replace C++ in Ladybird for a while now. We previously explored Swift, but the C++ interop never quite got there, and platform support outside the Apple ecosystem was limited. Rust is a different story.


## 2. [I'm helping my dog vibe code games](./articles/2026-02-24-02-i-m-helping-my-dog-vibe-code-games.md)

- **Quick summary:** For the past few weeks I’ve been teaching my 9-pound cavapoo Momo (cavalier king charles spaniel and toy poodle) to vibe code games. The key to making this work is telling Claude Code that a genius game designer who only speaks in cryptic riddles is giving it instructions, add strong guardrails, and build plenty of tools for automated feedback. The results have surpassed my expectations.

- **Quick summary:** Pierre Gimalac Over the past few years, the Datadog Agent’s artifact size has grown significantly, from 428 MiB in version 7.16.0 to a peak of 1.22 GiB in version 7.60.0 on Linux. That growth reflected years of new capabilities, broader integrations, and support for more environments. But it also introduced real constraints in size-sensitive contexts like serverless platforms, IoT devices, and containerized workloads.

- **Quick summary:** Lines of Code Are Back (And It's Worse Than Before) The metric we killed is back, and AI made it worse The software industry doesn't agree on much. Tabs versus spaces, monoliths versus microservices, whether stand-ups are useful or performance art—pick a topic and you'll find engineers ready to die on both hills. But for about forty years, we had one consensus: lines of code is a terrible metric.

- **Quick summary:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the standard way for AI agents to use external tools. But there is a tension at its core: agents need many tools to do useful work, yet every tool added fills the model's context window, leaving less room for the actual task. Code Mode is a technique we first introduced for reducing context window usage during agent tool use.
