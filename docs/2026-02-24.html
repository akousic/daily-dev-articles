While we do recognize the importance of platform security and user safety, the Android platform already includes multiple security mechanisms that do not require central registration. Forcibly injecting an alien security model that runs counter to Android’s historic open nature threatens innovation, competition, privacy, and user freedom.</p><p><a href='https://keepandroidopen.org/open-letter/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Original link ↗</a></p></div><div class='card'><h2>7. <a href='./articles/2026-02-24-07-a-new-chapter-dev-is-joining-forces-with-major-league-hacking-mlh.html'>A New Chapter: DEV is Joining Forces with Major League Hacking (MLH)</a></h2><p class='meta'><span class='badge'>Dev.to</span>reactions 386, comments 96</p><p>Hey everyone, I have some massive news to share today, and I couldn&#x27;t be more excited to finally type these words.
