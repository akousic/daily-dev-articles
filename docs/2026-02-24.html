We previously explored Swift, but the C++ interop never quite got there, and platform support outside the Apple ecosystem was limited.

The key to making this work is telling Claude Code that a genius game designer who only speaks in cryptic riddles is giving it instructions, add strong guardrails, and build plenty of tools for automated feedback. The results have surpassed my expectations.</p><p><a href='https://www.calebleak.com/posts/dog-game/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Original link ↗</a></p></div><div class='card'><h2>3. <a href='./articles/2026-02-24-03-firefox-148-launches-with-ai-kill-switch-feature-and-more-enhancements.html'>Firefox 148 Launches with AI Kill Switch Feature and More Enhancements</a></h2><p class='meta'><span class='badge'>Hacker News</span>HN score 440</p><p>The latest update of Firefox, version 148, introduces a much-anticipated &quot;AI kill switch&quot; feature, allowing users to disable AI functionalities such as chatbot prompts and AI-generated link summaries.

While we do recognize the importance of platform security and user safety, the Android platform already includes multiple security mechanisms that do not require central registration. Forcibly injecting an alien security model that runs counter to Android’s historic open nature threatens innovation, competition, privacy, and user freedom.</p><p><a href='https://keepandroidopen.org/open-letter/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Original link ↗</a></p></div><div class='card'><h2>7. <a href='./articles/2026-02-24-07-mock-the-hype-post-the-software-development-lifecycle-is-dead-boris-tane.html'>[Mock the hype post] The Software Development Lifecycle Is Dead | Boris Tane</a></h2><p class='meta'><span class='badge'>Reddit (programming)</span>score 219, comments 93</p><p>The Software Development Lifecycle Is Dead AI agents didn’t make the SDLC faster.

A lot of these papers claim to train huge models and present SOTA performance in the results section/tables but provide no way for anyone to try the model out themselves. Since the models are so expensive/labor intensive to train from scratch, there is no way for anyone to check whether: (1) the results are entirely fabricated; (2) they trained on the test data or (3) there is some other evaluation error in the methodology.</p><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1rdca7x/d_papers_with_no_code/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Original link ↗</a></p></div><div class='card'><h2>10. <a href='./articles/2026-02-24-10-writing-code-is-cheap-now.html'>Writing code is cheap now</a></h2><p class='meta'><span class='badge'>Hacker News</span>HN score 334</p><p>Guides &gt; Agentic Engineering Patterns Writing code is cheap now The biggest challenge in adopting agentic engineering practices is getting comfortable with the consequences of the fact that writing code is cheap now.
