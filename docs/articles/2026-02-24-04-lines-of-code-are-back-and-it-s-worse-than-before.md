## Summary

Lines of Code Are Back (And It's Worse Than Before) The metric we killed is back, and AI made it worse The software industry doesn't agree on much. Tabs versus spaces, monoliths versus microservices, whether stand-ups are useful or performance art—pick a topic and you'll find engineers ready to die on both hills. But for about forty years, we had one consensus: lines of code is a terrible metric.

## Key Takeaways

- Dijkstra called it "a very costly measuring unit because it encourages the writing of insipid code." Lines are spent, not produced.
- Bill Gates compared measuring programming progress by lines of code to measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
- Ken Thompson said one of his most productive days was throwing away a thousand lines.
