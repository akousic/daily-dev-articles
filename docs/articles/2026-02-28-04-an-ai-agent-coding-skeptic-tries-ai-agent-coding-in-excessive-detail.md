## Summary

You’ve likely seen many blog posts about AI agent coding/vibecoding where the author talks about all the wonderful things agents can now do supported by vague anecdata, how agents will lead to the atrophy of programming skills, how agents impugn the sovereignty of the human soul, etc etc. This is NOT one of those posts. Last May, I wrote a blog post titled As an Experienced LLM User, I Actually Don’t Use Generative LLMs Often as a contrasting response to the hype around the rising popularity of agentic coding.

## Key Takeaways

- In that post, I noted that while LLMs are most definitely not useless and they can answer simple coding questions faster than it would take for me to write it myself with sufficient accuracy, agents are a tougher sell: they are unpredictable, expensive, and the hype around it was wildly disproportionate given the results I had seen in personal usage.
- However, I concluded that I was open to agents if LLMs improved enough such that all my concerns were addressed and agents were more dependable.
- In the months since, I continued my real-life work as a Data Scientist while keeping up-to-date on the latest LLMs popping up on OpenRouter.
