$ npm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent Pi is a minimal terminal coding harness. Adapt pi to your workflows, not the other way around. Extend it with TypeScript extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes.

## Key Takeaways

- Pi ships with powerful defaults but skips features like sub-agents and plan mode.
- Ask pi to build what you want, or install a package that does it your way.
