## Summary

pre-commit is a framework to run hooks written in many languages, and it manages the language toolchain and dependencies for running the hooks. prek is a reimagined version of pre-commit, built in Rust. It is designed to be a faster, dependency-free and drop-in alternative for it, while also providing some additional long-requested features.

## Key Takeaways

- Note Although prek is pretty new, it’s already powering real‑world projects like CPython, Apache Airflow, FastAPI, and more projects are picking it up—see Who is using prek?.
