## Summary

Thiago Ghisi explained how he guided managers and senior ICs to build a resilient leadership group beneath him in his talk Lessons from Growing Engineering Organizations at QCon London. Regular syncs, expectation calibration, and alignment on broader goals made leaders multipliers of culture and performance. Culture is what you do, not what you say, he argued.

- They started with an off-site where managers and senior ICs shared personal struggles, like repeated incidents or scope confusion, and also aligned on priorities and goals for the next cycle as a team in a format similar to a Lean Inception.
