## Summary

The fastest reasoning LLM, powered by diffusion Today, we're introducing Mercury 2 — the world's fastest reasoning language model, built to make production AI feel instant. Why speed matters more now Production AI isn't one prompt and one answer anymore. It's loops: agents, retrieval pipelines, and extraction jobs running in the background at volume.

## Key Takeaways

- In loops, latency doesn’t show up once.
- It compounds across every step, every user, every retry.
- Yet current LLMs still share the same bottleneck: autoregressive, sequential decoding.
