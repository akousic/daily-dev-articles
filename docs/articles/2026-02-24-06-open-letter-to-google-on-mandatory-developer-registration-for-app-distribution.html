    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Date: February 24, 2026 To: Sundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer, Google To: Sergey Brin, Founder and Board Member, Google To: Larry Page, Founder and Board Member, Google To: Vijaya Kaza, General Manager for App &amp; Ecosystem Trust, Google CC: Regulatory authorities, policymakers, and the Android developer community Re: Mandatory Developer Registration for Android App Distribution We, the undersigned organizations representing civil society, nonprofit institutions, and technology companies, write to express our strong opposition to Google’s announced policy requiring all Android app developers to register centrally with Google themselves in order to distribute applications outside of the Google Play Store, set to take effect worldwide in the coming months. While we do recognize the importance of platform security and user safety, the Android platform already includes multiple security mechanisms that do not require central registration. Forcibly injecting an alien security model that runs counter to Android’s historic open nature threatens innovation, competition, privacy, and user freedom.</p>
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul><li>We urge Google to withdraw this policy and work with the open-source and security communities on less restrictive alternatives.</li><li>Gatekeeping Beyond Google’s Own Store Android has historically been characterized as an open platform where users and developers can operate independently of Google’s services.</li><li>The proposed developer registration policy fundamentally alters that relationship by requiring developers who wish to distribute apps through alternative channels — their own websites, third-party app stores, enterprise distribution systems, or direct transfers — to first seek permission from Google through a mandatory verification process, which involves the agreement to Google’s terms and conditions, the payment of a fee, and the uploading of government-issued identification.</li></ul>
