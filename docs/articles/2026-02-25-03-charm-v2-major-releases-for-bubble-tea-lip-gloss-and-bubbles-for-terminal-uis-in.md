## Summary

v2.0.0 versions of Bubble Tea, Lip Gloss, and Bubbles are out of beta and ready to rock. These releases bring highly optimized rendering, advanced compositing, higher-fidelity input handling, and a more declarative API for very predictable output. The v2 branches have been powering Crush, our AI coding agent, in production from the very beginning.
