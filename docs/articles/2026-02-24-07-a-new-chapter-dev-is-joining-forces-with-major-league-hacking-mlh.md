## Summary

Hey everyone, I have some massive news to share today, and I couldn't be more excited to finally type these words. DEV is officially joining forces and becoming part of the Major League Hacking (MLH) organization. It has been quite an adventure getting to this point, and I view today not as an end, but as a genuine new beginning.

## Key Takeaways

- As I write this, DEV is officially part of the MLH organization.
- The original team isn’t going anywhere, and I’m already hard at work in my new role at MLH.
- We are incredibly excited to combine our resources to make DEV the best it can be, and likewise empower MLH and the Forem open source project—the software that powers the DEV community—to be the best they can be.
