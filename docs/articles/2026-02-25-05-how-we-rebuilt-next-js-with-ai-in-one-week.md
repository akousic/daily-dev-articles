## Summary

*This post was updated at 12:35 pm PT to fix a typo in the build time benchmarks. Last week, one engineer and an AI model rebuilt the most popular front-end framework from scratch. The result, vinext (pronounced "vee-next"), is a drop-in replacement for Next.js, built on Vite, that deploys to Cloudflare Workers with a single command.

## Key Takeaways

- In early benchmarks, it builds production apps up to 4x faster and produces client bundles up to 57% smaller.
- And we already have customers running it in production.
- The whole thing cost about $1,100 in tokens.
