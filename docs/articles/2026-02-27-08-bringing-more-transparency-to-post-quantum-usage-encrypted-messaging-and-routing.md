## Summary

Cloudflare Radar already offers a wide array of security insights — from application and network layer attacks, to malicious email messages, to digital certificates and Internet routing. And today we’re introducing even more. We are launching several new security-related data sets and tools on Radar: We are extending our post-quantum (PQ) monitoring beyond the client side to now include origin-facing connections.

## Key Takeaways

- We have also released a new tool to help you check any website's post-quantum encryption compatibility.
- A new Key Transparency section on Radar provides a public dashboard showing the real-time verification status of Key Transparency Logs for end-to-end encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp, showing when each log was last signed and verified by Cloudflare's Auditor.
- The page serves as a transparent interface where anyone can monitor the integrity of public key distribution and access the API to independently validate our Auditor’s proofs.
