## Summary

Microsoft has released the first preview of ASP.NET Core in .NET 11, introducing a range of new features and improvements aimed at enhancing the developer experience across Blazor, OpenAPI, and general web development workflows. Among the most notable additions is the new EnvironmentBoundary component for Blazor, which allows developers to conditionally render content based on the hosting environment. The component accepts Include and Exclude parameters and works consistently across both Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly, removing, as explained, the need for manual environment checks.

## Key Takeaways

- The release also brings several improvements to Blazor forms.
- A new Label component now renders accessible labels with automatic extraction of display names from metadata attributes.
- It supports both nested and non-nested label-input association patterns.
