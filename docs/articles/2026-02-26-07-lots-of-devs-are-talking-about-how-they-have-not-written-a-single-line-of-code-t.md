## Summary

Lots of devs are talking about how they have not written a single line of code the last year or so. How much does this cost to them (or to their employer)? So, everybody is talking about the efficiency of LLMs in writting the code, but no one is talking about the cost.

## Key Takeaways

- Please, share your experiences.
- I am stunned to hear things like "AI agents have solved all our issues and we have not enough time to merge them in production", "I have 3 agents working for me and I work only 20 minutes a day", and "I am making 120k per month by having my agents do all the work", but I don't get how can someone affort this.
- And if they can, for how long is this going to be that cheap?
