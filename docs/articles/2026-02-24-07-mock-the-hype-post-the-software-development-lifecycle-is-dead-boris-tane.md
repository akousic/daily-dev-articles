## Summary

The Software Development Lifecycle Is Dead AI agents didn’t make the SDLC faster. I keep hearing people talk about AI as a “10x developer tool.” That framing is wrong. It assumes the workflow stays the same and the speed goes up.

## Key Takeaways

- That’s not what’s happening.
- The entire lifecycle, the one we’ve built careers around, the one that spawned a multi-billion dollar tooling industry, is collapsing in on itself.
- And most people haven’t noticed yet.
