## Summary

Voice Interfaces for Everyone - Quickstart - When should you choose Moonshine over Whisper? - Using the Library - Models - API Reference - Support - Roadmap - Acknowledgements - License Moonshine Voice is an open source AI toolkit for developers building real-time voice applications. - Everything runs on-device, so it's fast, private, and you don't need an account, credit card, or API keys.

## Key Takeaways

- - The framework and models are optimized for live streaming applications, offering low latency responses by doing a lot of the work while the user is still talking.
- - All models are based on our cutting edge research and trained from scratch, so we can offer higher accuracy than Whisper Large V3 at the top end, down to tiny 26MB models for constrained deployments.
- - It's easy to integrate across platforms, with the same library running on Python, iOS, Android, MacOS, Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pis, IoT devices, and wearables.
