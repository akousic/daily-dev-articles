## Summary

Last week, we announced that DEV has joined Major League Hacking. To kick things off, we're launching a writing challenge about a topic both communities are already familiar with: Google Gemini. Running through March 4 at 11:59 AM ET, the Built with Google Gemini: Writing Challenge presented by MLH will be an opportunity to show off what you've built with Google Gemini, reflect on your experience, and share what you're up to next!

## Key Takeaways

- Whether you competed at an MLH hackathon, tackled a DEV Challenge, or hacked on something independently with Google Gemini as your go-to, we want to hear about it.
- Five winners will walk away with a Raspberry Pi AI Kit for writing the best articles.
- As is tradition with DEV Challenges, all participants will receive a completion badge.
