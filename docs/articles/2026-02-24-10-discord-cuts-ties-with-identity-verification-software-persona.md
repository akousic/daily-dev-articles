## Summary

Communication platform Discord is under fire after its identity verification software, Persona Identities, was found to have front-end code accessible on the open internet and on government servers. Nearly 2,500 accessible files were found sitting on a U.S. government-authorized endpoint, researchers pointed out on X.

## Key Takeaways

- The files showed Persona conducted facial recognition checks against watchlists and screened users against lists of politically exposed persons.
- In addition to verifying a user’s age, researchers found Persona performs 269 distinct verification checks, including screening for “adverse media” across 14 different categories such as terrorism and espionage.
- It then assigns risk and similarity scores to user information.
