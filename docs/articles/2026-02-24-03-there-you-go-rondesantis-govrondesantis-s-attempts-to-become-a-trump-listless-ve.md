## Summary

FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—The White House is engaging against a Florida bill that would establish limits on artificial intelligence, including protections for minors, sources familiar with the matter tell The Daily Signal. The White House has contacted Florida Speaker of the House Daniel Perez and his staff members about opposing Gov. Ron DeSantis’ Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights, sources said.

## Key Takeaways

- So far, Perez has sent the bill through four committees in the House since its introduction early this year.
- Perez told reporters on Tuesday that he is skeptical that states should pass legislation on an issue where the federal government has “first dibs.” “I’ve been very clear that I think AI is an issue that should be dealt with by the federal government.
- I have massive concerns with the state’s ability to deal with anything in tech,” Perez said.
