## Summary

Hugging Face Skills are definitions for AI/ML tasks like dataset creation, model training, and evaluation. They are interoperable with all major coding agent tools like OpenAI Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, Google DeepMind's Gemini CLI, and Cursor. The Skills in this repository follow the standardized format Agent Skill format.

## Key Takeaways

- In practice, skills are self-contained folders that package instructions, scripts, and resources together for an AI agent to use on a specific use case.
- Each folder includes a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) followed by the guidance your coding agent follows while the skill is active.
- Note 'Skills' is actually an Anthropic term used within Claude AI and Claude Code and not adopted by other agent tools, but we love it!
