## Summary

In 2017, Samsung stood on stage at its Developer Conference and announced one of the most exciting sustainability ideas the smartphone industry had seen. Galaxy Upcycling would let you take your old Galaxy phone, unlock its bootloader, and turn it into whatever you wanted: a smart home sensor, a baby monitor, a Linux computer, a retro gaming console. iFixit co-launched the program.

## Key Takeaways

- The open-source community was thrilled, especially given that Samsung had a GitHub page for it and everything.
- Then nothing happened.
- When Samsung finally shipped something called "Galaxy Upcycling at Home" in 2021, it bore almost no resemblance to what was promised.
