    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Guides &gt; Agentic Engineering Patterns Writing code is cheap now The biggest challenge in adopting agentic engineering practices is getting comfortable with the consequences of the fact that writing code is cheap now. Code has always been expensive. Producing a few hundred lines of clean, tested code takes most software developers a full day or more.</p>
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul><li>Many of our engineering habits, at both the macro and micro level, are built around this core constraint.</li><li>At the macro level we spend a great deal of time designing, estimating and planning out projects, to ensure that our expensive coding time is spent as efficiently as possible.</li><li>Product feature ideas are evaluated in terms of how much value they can provide in exchange for that time - a feature needs to earn its development costs many times over to be worthwhile!</li></ul>
