## Summary

I’m one of those developers who’s had the privilege of writing code by hand in its rawest form, the kind who wrote every line by hand. Just raw logic, caffeine, and a blinking cursor. I used to write code for work, in my free time, when I was stressed, when I was happy, In my dreams, I still write code.

## Key Takeaways

- I did it because creating something, fixing issues, building systems...
- That feeling of fulfillment when you’d step back, look at what you built, and think: I’m a genius.
- Back then, you weren’t just assembling components, you were constructing mental models.
