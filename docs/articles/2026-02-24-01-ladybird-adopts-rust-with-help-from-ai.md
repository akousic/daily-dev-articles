## Summary

We’ve been searching for a memory-safe programming language to replace C++ in Ladybird for a while now. We previously explored Swift, but the C++ interop never quite got there, and platform support outside the Apple ecosystem was limited. Rust is a different story.

## Key Takeaways

- The ecosystem is far more mature for systems programming, and many of our contributors already know the language.
- Going forward, we are rewriting parts of Ladybird in Rust.
- When we originally evaluated Rust back in 2024, we rejected it because it’s not great at C++ style OOP.
