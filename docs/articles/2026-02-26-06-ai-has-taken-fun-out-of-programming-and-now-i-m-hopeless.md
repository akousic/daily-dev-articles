## Summary

AI has taken fun out of programming and now i’m hopeless Going to be a rant. Gone are the days where you could take pride in developing a feature or fixing a sprint blocking bug that no one in the team could solve. Gone are the days when your knowledge, skills snd logic building were things which would add value to your role or candidature for the company.

## Key Takeaways

- I dont get the same zeal anymore when one person can just write a prompt and achieve the same results in lesser time.
- Moreover, with the recent updates from Claude i wonder if developers or going to last.
- Please note, i’m not naive.
