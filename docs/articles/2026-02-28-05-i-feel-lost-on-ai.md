## Summary

I’m a 46-year-old programmer from Mexico. I’ve been doing this work for a little more than twenty-six years now, and I don’t want to stop. Writing code is not just a way of living for me.

## Key Takeaways

- It’s what drives me most of the day.
- It’s the first thing in my mind when I wake up in the morning, and the last when I turn off for the night.
- When I’m done, I hope I can be at peace with myself, knowing I did what I could to write all the code I dreamed of.
