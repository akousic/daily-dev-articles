## Summary

The latest update of Firefox, version 148, introduces a much-anticipated "AI kill switch" feature, allowing users to disable AI functionalities such as chatbot prompts and AI-generated link summaries. Mozilla emphasizes that once AI features are turned off, future updates will not override this choice. This decision reflects the company’s new revenue-focused strategy regarding AI integrations.

## Key Takeaways

- To disable AI features, users can navigate to Settings > AI Controls and toggle the ‘Block AI Enhancements’ option.
- This will prevent any in-app notifications encouraging users to try out AI features, as well as remove any previously downloaded AI models from the device.
- For those who wish to maintain some AI functionalities, a selective blocking option is available, enabling users to retain useful features like on-device translations while avoiding cloud-based services.
