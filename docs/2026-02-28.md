- **Quick summary:** Computer Science > Programming Languages [Submitted on 20 Feb 2026] Title:Package Managers à la Carte: A Formal Model of Dependency Resolution View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Package managers are legion. Every programming language and operating system has its own solution, each with subtly different semantics for dependency resolution. This fragmentation prevents multilingual projects from expressing precise dependencies across language ecosystems; it leaves external system and hardware dependencies implicit and unversioned; it obscures security vulnerabilities that lie in the full dependency graph.

- **Quick summary:** You’ve likely seen many blog posts about AI agent coding/vibecoding where the author talks about all the wonderful things agents can now do supported by vague anecdata, how agents will lead to the atrophy of programming skills, how agents impugn the sovereignty of the human soul, etc etc. This is NOT one of those posts. Last May, I wrote a blog post titled As an Experienced LLM User, I Actually Don’t Use Generative LLMs Often as a contrasting response to the hype around the rising popularity of agentic coding.

- **Quick summary:** I’m one of those developers who’s had the privilege of writing code by hand in its rawest form, the kind who wrote every line by hand. Just raw logic, caffeine, and a blinking cursor. I used to write code for work, in my free time, when I was stressed, when I was happy, In my dreams, I still write code.

- **Quick summary:** At 3 AM, a single IP requested a login page. But then, across several hosts and paths, the same source began appending ?debug=true — the sign of an attacker probing the environment to assess the technology stack and plan a breach. Minor misconfigurations, overlooked firewall events, or request anomalies feel harmless on their own.
